# BNRBot
## Preface
**B**attle.**N**et **R**ealbasic **Bot** is a
[Battle.net&trade;](http://battle.net) binary chat bot written by Carl Bennett
(Jailout2000).

It was started in 2011 and went on hiatus in 2012. In late 2015, it was added
to version control on GitHub, where some much needed updates were done to it.

Some of its bragging rights include:
- Handling heavy loads and floods in Battle.net channels.
- Compatible with official Battle.net, PvPGN, emNet, and other custom servers.
- Binary-compatible with Windows XP up to Windows 10.
- Multiple profiles.
- Easy to use.

Give it a try!

## Installation
1. Go to the
   [latest release](https://github.com/carlbennett/BNRBot/releases/latest).
2. Download BNCSUtil, BNRBot, CheckRevision, and Hashes. (You can skip some of
   these if you already have used BNRBot.)
3. Extract BNCSUtil and CheckRevision into your `C:\Windows` directory.
4. Extract BNRBot into its own directory.
5. Extract Hashes into BNRBot's directory under its own `Hashes` directory.
6. Open BNRBot and read the information it gives you.

## Open-source
The bot is officially open-source with it being on GitHub and releases being
released on GitHub as well. If you find a bug, make sure you open a new issue
here on GitHub, and feel free to try to fix it yourself. If not, your issue
will be worked on by someone who can address it.

Thanks for contributing!

### Real Studio
If you wish to contribute, you will need to run **Real Studio 2012r2.1**. All
code changes are made within the IDE, which is why a lot of the commits and the
code in general looks pretty awful; it's actually not too bad when viewing from
the IDE. Real Studio does pre- and post-formatting when reading and writing
files, so it's not really easy to beautify the code from a Git perspective.
