# BNRBot
## Preface
**B**attle.**N**et **R**ealbasic **Bot** is a [Classic
Battle.net&trade;](http://classic.battle.net) chat bot written by
[@carlbennett](https://github.com/carlbennett)
([Jailout2000](http://jailout2000.com)) and licensed under the
[Creative Commons BY-NC-ND 4.0
International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) license.

It was started in 2011 and went on hiatus in 2012. In late 2015, it was added
to version control on GitHub and received lots of updates. It's been maintained
here ever since.

Some of its bragging rights include:
- Handling heavy loads and floods in Battle.net chat channels.
- Compatible with official Classic Battle.net, PvPGN, emNet, and other custom
  servers.
- Compatiblility with Windows XP up to Windows 10.
- Multiple profiles and switching via tabbed (actually a list box) interface.
- User interface is consistent throughout, allowing easy learning of the bot.

Give it a try!

## Open-source
With the use of GitHub, this bot is open-source to the general public. All bot
releases are also made using GitHub too. If you find a bug, make sure you
[open a new issue](https://github.com/carlbennett/BNRBot/issues/new), and feel
free to try to fix it yourself. If not, your issue will be worked on by someone
who can address it.

Thanks for contributing!

### Real Studio
If you wish to contribute, you will need to run **Real Studio 2012r2.1**. All
code changes are made within the IDE, which is why a lot of the commits and the
code in general looks pretty awful; it's actually not too bad when viewing from
within the IDE. Real Studio does pre- and post-formatting when reading and
writing files, so it's not really easy to beautify the code from a Git/GitHub
perspective.
